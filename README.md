# Hospital Financial Data Analysis: A Statistical Exploration

## Overview
This project embarked on an analytical journey to understand the financial landscape of hospitals across various counties in California. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset detailing operational and financial metrics, the study aimed to uncover patterns, predict net income based on operational metrics, and explore financial disparities between urban and rural hospitals.

## Data
The analysis utilized a dataset encompassing financial metrics for hospitals, including total discharges, operating expenses, operational days, net income, bed utilization rate, and full-time equivalent nurses, across different Californian counties.

## Analysis Highlights
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Provided insight into the distribution of key metrics like net income, operational hours, and nurse staffing levels, revealing significant variability and skewness in the data.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Between Riverside (rural) and Los Angeles (urban) counties highlighted financial disparities, with urban hospitals showing a wider range of net incomes.
- **Regression Analysis:** Utilizing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) demonstrated strong predictability of nurse staffing levels based on operational metrics, with an R-squared value of 0.919.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** On the net income difference between hospitals in rural vs. urban settings found no significant difference, challenging some common perceptions about urban-rural financial disparities.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identified a positive correlation between net income and total operating expenses, suggesting larger hospitals may have both higher expenses and incomes.

## Key Findings
- Many hospitals, especially in urban areas like Los Angeles County, have lower net incomes, but a few outliers possess significantly higher net incomes.
- A positive correlation exists between total operating expenses and net income, indicating potential factors like hospital size, services offered, and location impacting financial outcomes.

## Conclusion
This project shed light on the complex financial dynamics within California's healthcare sector, emphasizing the need for data-driven decision-making to optimize financial performance in the face of evolving healthcare challenges.
